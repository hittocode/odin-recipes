       <li>Harina Pan or any tamale corn flour.</li>
       <li>An additional cup of water for each cup of corn flour.</li>
       <li>Pinch of salt.</li>

   <h4><Strong><em>Steps</em></Strong></h4>
   <ol>
       <li>Mix the flour inside a bowl with water. Remember to add an additional measurement of water for how much flour you will mix. (1 cup flour, 2 cups water)</li>
       <li>While mixing, add salt and soft butter.</li>
       <li>Continue mixing until the flour has absorbed all the water into a nice clay-like consistence</li>
       <li>Scoop a bit out and roll into a ball, then flatten with the palm of your hands until you have a nice flat round wheel</li>
       <li>Poke a hole right in the center of the wheel and dip into the frying oil. The hole helps it cook thoroughly.</li>
       <li>When the arepa is crispy and golden, let it soak into a paper tissue to remove any excess oil.</li>
       <li>When it's not scorching hot anymore, slice it open in the middle and fill with your filling of choice.</li>
       
   </ol>
