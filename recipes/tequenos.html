<p>Let's learn how to make the top-tier critically-acclaimed number one favorite snack of every Venezuelan. Good for events, breakfast, birthdays, lunch, funerals, quarantines, you name it.</p>
<h4><strong>Ingredientes</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Salted butter</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>White consistent cheese or Guava jelly</li>
    <li>Salt</li> 
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the all-purpose flour together with water and butter.</li>
    <li>After mixing, let it set for 30 minutes in a sealed container or covered in a dry cloth.</li>
    <li>Flatten very well, many times over, folding in half and re-flattening until reaching a nice thick sheet of dough.</li>
    <li>Slice into rectangles with the size of your preference</li>
    <li>On the narrow border of the rectangle, add a piece of cheese <em>(optional: Ham)</em>, or guava jelly...or both if you're cool enough.</li>
    <li>Roll it up! Place into cooking oil of choice or into the oven.</li>
    <li>Heat until it reaches a cirspy golden texture. Eat with a mix of mayo and ketchup for the genuine experience.</li>
